# Crunching

A resource pack for Minecraft 24w40a to rename the "Creaking" (and all associated blocks/subtitles) to the "Crunching"

Availible on Modrinth as soon as they add they option for 24w40a in the Versions tab (probably next week).

Translations welcome, just open a pull request and make a new .json in `assets/minecraft/lang` with the correct name for the language.
